# Belly Button Biodiversity 
## Overview
The purpose of this project focused on building a webpage to visualize data using Plotly.js, a javascript visualization library. We were able to make interactive charts such as a bar chart, bubble chart, and a gauge chart. We lastly made some changes to our index.html code and designed the dashboard of the overall webpage by adding background images, a paragraph explaining the purpose of the research, and brief texts describing each chart.
